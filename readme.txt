At the end of an article, readers can evaluate the content according to five emotions.

Get immediate feedback from your users regarding how they feel about your content. Learn what emotions users are feeling and which content is evoking the most emotion. Feelbacks, emotional rating system, prompts users to share their reaction to an article by clicking on one of the five emotions. In turn they are provided with content recommendations based on their current mood.
